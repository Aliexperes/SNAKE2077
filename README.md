Hi everyone this is SNAKE2077!

Play that old snake game with a new fresh cyber feeling!

The game unfortunately isn't mobile friendly but you can play on desktop browsers.

playing guide is simple and you have to start the game by clicking on play icon or just by pressig Enter button, and move the snake by pressing your arrow keys (↑, →, ↓, ←) on your keyboard!

Hope you guys enjoy it and i will be glad if you report bugs or send a pull request to fixing them:)
